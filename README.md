### Auto Albums
The purpose of this project is to maintain derivative Google Photos albums programmatically. In particular, I'm creating a dynamic album of the N most recent photos from one album to populate another.

## How to run

(Instructions borrowed from [Photos-Upload](https://github.com/shraiysh/Photos-Upload) thanks)

1. Download `client_secret.json` in the `src` folder.
 - Go to the [Google API Console](https://console.developers.google.com/apis/).
 - From the menu bar, select a project or create a new project.
 - To open the Google API Library, from the Navigation menu, select APIs & Services > Library.
 - Search for "Google Photos Library API". Select the correct result and click Enable.
 - Under Credentials for your project, create OAuth Client ID for **other** and open the newly created credentials link
 - Download JSON as `client_secret.json` in the src folder

```
$ cd src
$ python3 main.py [folder-path]
```
